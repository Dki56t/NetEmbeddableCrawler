This is a small tool to make a dump of a whole web site.
It can save it to a file system, automatically retarget urls to local directories.
It can also load scripts, other resources or even html pages linked by target (may be you would like to access web site without internet connection). This feature can be disabled with FullTraversal option.
You can use this tool when you need some automation in site dumping. For instance when you need to track changes of the web pages.
