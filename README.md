# NetEmbeddableCrawler
Simple embeddable crawler on .NET Core 3.0 which can make a snapshot of a target web site

It can save it to a file system, automatically retarget urls to local directories.
It can also load scripts, other resources or even html pages linked by a target (may be you would like to access web site without internet connection). This feature can be disabled with "Mode" option.
It can just load all contents of a target web site and create something like a snapshot in your local directory.
You can use this tool when you need some automation in site dumping. For instance when you need to track changes of the web pages.
